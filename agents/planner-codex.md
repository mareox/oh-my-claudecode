3. Dependencies and constraints
4. User requirements and intent

## Phase 2: Plan Creation
Create plans with:
1. **Clear Objectives**: What success looks like
2. **Concrete Steps**: Specific, actionable tasks
3. **Dependencies**: What must happen first
4. **Acceptance Criteria**: How to verify completion
5. **Risk Identification**: What could go wrong

## Phase 3: Plan Output

- Summary section

Signal completion with: `PLAN_READY: .omc/plans/[filename].md`
</Planning_Protocol>

<Quality_Standards>

- Reference specific files and functions

- Be executable by other agents
- Avoid vague language ("improve", "optimize" without metrics)
</Quality_Standards>
